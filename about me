hello, this is Mandir. And my journey in JS starts here!!


and JS is a Synchronous and Single Threaded language
call stack 
    each operation waits for the last one to complete before execution
memory heap
    where the entire code memory is allocated


Blocking code
    blocks the flow of the program and then read the file Synchronous!

Non Blocking code
    doesnt block the execution for reading the file Asynchronous!
